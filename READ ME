This is my senior design (capstone design) project at LSU for Fall 2018-Spring 2019. I will be including the software(s), resources, and
maybe even reports.

Not all the work is mine and authors/creators of content will be cited.

I am the lead on "software development," using the term somewhat loosely. I am not a professional (as you might have guessed from my other
repositories). Please read the report that I will put up in order to understand my project before moving on. 

Projects:
  1. NASA (Marshall center)- Needs a handheld device that saves to a microSD.
  2. Dr. Guo (LSU)- Wants a tabletop version that is operated remotely via USB cable (just the next room over). [UPDATE: Scraped. Only 
  project one will be actually worked on]

The main components of the projects code are:
  1. The on-board Arduino software for operating the device (both projects).
      a. Controlling the actuator and hook assembly
    	b. Logging data from a load cell and an encoder on an SD card
	   c. Displaying the maximum force that the load cell reads during a test
