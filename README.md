# UWP-App-for-Adruino-Senior-Design-
This will be part of my senior design project at LSU (EE4810/EE4820). (See below for a more detailed description)

This repository will mainly focus on the UWP app, but I'll be including the Arduino code as well. This is more for 
me to have a backup and to have my "portfolio" of my coding work. If it helps you GREAT!
