# Senior-Design-NASA Tensile Tester

This is more for me to have a backup and to have my "portfolio" of my coding work. If it helps you GREAT!

UPDATED
There has been a change of scope for this project and there will no longer be an UWP to accompany project. The project will be mainly on 
just the handle held device for NASA (Marshall Space Flight Center, AL). It’s a long story and this isn’t the place to complain about my 
university/college.

### Project Progress:
- [X] Complete fall design semester
- [X] Begin manufacturing process
- [X] Begin testing itterations
- [ ] Present device to panel (instructorr/industry)
- [ ] Complete final report/documentation
- [ ] Graduate!
